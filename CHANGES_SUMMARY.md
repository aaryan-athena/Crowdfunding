# Summary of Changes - Model Sensitivity Enhancement

## Problem
Your model predictions were not changing significantly when you adjusted input parameters. Small changes in numerical values and categorical selections were not affecting the final prediction meaningfully.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Limited Feature Engineering**: Only basic one-hot encoding was used
2. **Missing Interaction Features**: No feature interactions to capture combined effects
3. **No Feature Scaling**: Large-magnitude features dominated small ones
4. **Suboptimal Model Parameters**: Could converge to better solution

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Interaction Features ✅

Added **50+ interaction features** including:

**Critical Interactions (High Impact):**
- `NumBackers × Category` - Different categories attract different backer behaviors
- `NumBackers × GoalAmount` - Combined effect of backers and goal size
- `NumBackers × DurationDays` - How campaign length affects backer engagement

**Important Interactions (Medium Impact):**
- `SocialMedia × NumUpdates` - Engagement factor
- `SocialMedia × NumBackers` - Social influence on backing
- `OwnerExperience × GoalAmount` - Experienced owners set realistic goals
- `OwnerExperience × NumBackers` - Experience attracts more backers

**Supporting Interactions (Moderate Impact):**
- `GoalAmount × Country/Currency` - Regional economic factors
- `VideoIncluded × NumBackers` - Video quality effect
- `VideoIncluded × SocialMedia` - Multimedia engagement

### 2. Feature Scaling (StandardScaler) ✅

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```

**Benefits:**
- Normalizes all features to same scale (mean=0, std=1)
- Prevents large features (GoalAmount) from dominating small ones (Experience)
- Improves model convergence and stability
- Makes coefficients more interpretable

### 3. Enhanced Model Parameters ✅

**Before:**
```python
BayesianRidge(n_iter=300, tol=1e-3, alpha_1=1e-6, ...)
```

**After:**
```python
BayesianRidge(
    n_iter=500,          # +67% more iterations
    tol=1e-4,            # Tighter convergence
    alpha_1=1e-5,        # Better regularization
    alpha_2=1e-5,
    lambda_1=1e-5,
    lambda_2=1e-5,
    fit_intercept=True
)
```

### 4. Updated Prediction Pipeline ✅

**Before:** Only passed base features
**After:** 
1. Creates all interaction features from user input
2. Applies StandardScaler transformation
3. Makes prediction with scaled features

```python
# Now creates features like:
user_input['NumBackers_x_Category_Technology'] = num_backers * is_technology
user_input['NumBackers_x_GoalAmount'] = num_backers * goal_amount
# ... and 40+ more interactions

# Then scales them
user_df_scaled = scaler.transform(user_df)
prediction = model.predict(user_df_scaled)[0]
```

- Added `requests==2.31.0` (for testing script)

### New Files Created

1. **`test_sensitivity.py`** - Comprehensive testing script
   - Tests 8 different parameter variations
   - Shows delta (Δ) from baseline for each change
   - Verifies model sensitivity improvements

2. **`IMPROVEMENTS.md`** - Detailed technical documentation
   - Explains each improvement
   - Shows before/after comparisons
   - Expected impact of each feature

3. **`QUICKSTART.md`** - Step-by-step testing guide
   - How to train the model locally
   - How to run sensitivity tests
   - How to deploy to Render

## Expected Impact on Predictions

### Strong Impact Features (Should show $5,000+ changes):
- **NumBackers**: 50 → 250 backers
- **GoalAmount**: $5,000 → $50,000
- **Category**: Technology vs Film vs Music

### Moderate Impact Features (Should show $1,000-5,000 changes):
- **SocialMedia + Updates**: Combined engagement
- **OwnerExperience**: Beginner vs Expert
- **Country/Currency**: USA vs UK vs Germany

### Supporting Features (Should show $500-1,000 changes):
- **VideoIncluded**: Yes vs No
- **DurationDays**: 15 vs 90 days
- **LaunchMonth**: Seasonal effects

## How to Verify

### Step 1: Local Testing
```bash
cd "c:\Users\AIT 33\Desktop\Crowdfunding"
python app.py  # Terminal 1 - Start server
python test_sensitivity.py  # Terminal 2 - Run tests
```

### Step 2: Check Test Output
Look for significant Δ (delta) values:
```
NumBackers: 50  → Prediction: $12,456.78 (Δ -$8,543.22)  ✅ Good!
NumBackers: 250 → Prediction: $29,876.54 (Δ +$8,876.54)  ✅ Good!
```

If all deltas are near $0, there's still an issue.

### Step 3: Deploy to Render
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Enhanced model with interaction features"
git push origin main
```

## Technical Details

### Why Interaction Features Matter

**Example 1: NumBackers × Category**
- 100 backers in Technology might mean $50/backer average
- 100 backers in Film might mean $30/backer average
- Without interaction: Model treats them the same ❌
- With interaction: Model learns category-specific patterns ✅

**Example 2: NumBackers × GoalAmount**
- High backers + Low goal = Oversubscribed (multiplier effect)
- Low backers + High goal = Undersubscribed (penalty effect)
- Interaction captures this non-linear relationship ✅

### Why Scaling Matters

**Before Scaling:**
- GoalAmount: Range [1,000 - 100,000] → Dominates model
- Experience: Range [1 - 10] → Barely affects model

**After Scaling:**
- GoalAmount: Range [-2 to +2] standard deviations
- Experience: Range [-2 to +2] standard deviations
- Both features have equal opportunity to influence predictions ✅

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Model training fails
- Check internet connection (downloads dataset from GitHub)
- Ensure all packages in requirements.txt are installed
- Check Python version (3.8+ recommended)

### Issue: Predictions still don't vary
- Verify model R² score > 0.5 during training
- Check test_sensitivity.py output for specific features
- Ensure scaler is being applied (check logs)

### Issue: Render deployment fails
- Confirm setuptools and wheel in requirements.txt
- Check Render logs for specific error
- Verify Procfile exists with correct command

## Success Metrics

✅ **Model trains successfully** - No errors, R² > 0.5  
✅ **NumBackers shows strong impact** - Δ > $5,000  
✅ **Categories predict differently** - Variations across categories  
✅ **Combinations matter** - Social+Updates > individual effects  
✅ **App runs on Render** - Deploys and responds to requests  

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Changes implemented
2. ⏳ Delete old model.pkl (done)
3. ⏳ Test locally with test_sensitivity.py
4. ⏳ Commit and push to GitHub
5. ⏳ Deploy to Render
6. ⏳ Verify live predictions vary appropriately
